"Harvest moon - Welcome! Wind's Bazaar" is one of Nintendoâ€™s NDS games. It is a member of the Harvest moon series.  
  
## Introduction  
This repo is base on web crawling recipe of the game "Harvest moon - Welcome! Wind's Bazaar".  
  
## Why Harvest Moon  
There is a game that I played before on NDSL, called "Harvest moon - Welcome! Wind's Bazaar" (of course Chinese version).  
However, I somehow lost my NDSL since I am busy studing when I was a junior high school student.  
At the summer vacation from sophomore to junior, my dad gave me a box and said: I found this in a drawer, is that yours?  
I quickly recognized that the thing in the box was the NDSL I lost in the junior high school.  
Now, I can finally enjoy this game that I haven't play since 14 years old.  
  
It's a pity that I forgot all of the recipes in this game. Thus, I decided to write a program to help me deal with this problem.  
  
## How to use  
The recipe is base on the webpages below:
